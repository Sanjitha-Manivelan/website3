My project is a place where you can learn the states and cities of US and it's called Quiz Website!

I made my project because I wanted to make a site where you can easily memorize the capitals and states.

I made it with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

I struggles with moving the pins around in the states review site and I learned how to create a quiz with mcq choices.
